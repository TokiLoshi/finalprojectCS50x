            <p class="card-text">Meat consumption can have a huge impact on the environment (roughly 100kg of CO2 equivaelent per kg of beef). Beef is also resource intensive, not only in terms of land usage and feed, but also water - it takes around 1,847 gallons of water (39 full bathubs) to produce one poud of beef. Are you up for the challenge to substitute one meat dish for a vegetarian option?</p>

            <p class="card-text">Switching from incandescent to LED lighting, is not only good for your carbon footprint but also for your wallet. LEDs use 75% less energy (lowering your energy bill and your footprint) and last up to 25 times longer. We challenge you to pick a room in your home that has incandescent lights and swap them out for LED lighting.</p>

            <p class="card-text">It takes 20 years for a plastic bag to degrade, and even then they degrade into microplastics which can land up in our drinking water and food. Every time you go to the grocery store if you use your own bags you are saving us all at least 20 years worth of plastic.</p>
